    <h1>Gyoza Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/gyoza.jpg">
    <p> Gyoza is a japanese food that resembles a dumpling typically filled with cabbage and ground pork.</p>
    <p> I will teach you how to make them! </p>
    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul> Pork </ul>
    <ul> Cabbage </ul>
    <ul> Chinese Chives </ul>
    <ul> Aromatics </ul>
    <ul> Seasonings </ul>
    <ul> Store bought gyoza wrappers</ul>
    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol> Kneed the dough </ol>
    <p> All you need to prepare the dough for the dumplings is flour, hot water and salt. Put the flower into a big bowl, making a small hole in the middle. Slowly pour in boiling water, gently stirring the dough with a spoon. When the ingredients start to blend together, knead them with your hands for about 2 minutes. When ready, wrap the dough in cling film or cover with a damp cloth and put aside for at least 15 minutes. According to some recipes, the dough should be left for up to an hour. In the meantime, you can prepare the meat stuffing.</p>
    <ol> Prepare the stuffing</ol>
    <p> There are a thousand ways to prepare gyoza. Next to typically meat stuffing, you can come across vegetarian or seafood dumplings. But if you want to prepare the most traditional version, stuff them with minced pork with chopped napa cabbage, garlic, ginger and chives. Season the raw ingredients with miso paste, sesame oil, chilli pepper and salt. Give it a thorough stir and knead the stuffing with your hands.</p>
    <ol> Form rings made of the dumpling dough </ol>
    <p>Even if you have never prepared Christmas Eve dumplings yourself, your first impulse would probably be to grab a rolling pin and a glass to cut out rings from finely rolled out dough. The Japanese have another way of forming the dumpling circles, though. Divide the dough into several parts. Mould each of them into a roll and cut it into small, even pieces, just as if shaping Polish kopytka. Sprinkle them with flour and flatten gently. Afterwards, roll out each of the rings or place them between two pieces of cling film and press with a heavy object. They should be about 8 cm in diameter. Make sure that their edges are slightly thinner than the centre. This will be very important as you seal the dumplings.</p>
    <ol> Fill in the dough with the stuffing and form dumplings</ol>
    <p>For the dough to seal more easily, slightly dampen its internal edges with a finger soaked in water. Put a tablespoonful of stuffing in the middle of each ring. Mould the dumplings by creating gentle accordion folds on the sealed edges. The Japanese describe the shape that ready gyoza should have as “peapods.”</p>
    <ol>Fry the gyoza on a pre-heated pan</ol>
    <p> Toss the dumplings on a medium-fried pan and gently pre-fry. When the dough starts turning brown, add about ¼ glassful of water and quickly cover the pan. Cook for 6-8 minutes, and then take off the lid to allow the water to evaporate. Keep frying the dumplings until they become golden brown at the bottom. This means that the crunchy gyoza are ready!
    <p>The taste of Japanese dumplings is perfectly emphasised by a sauce based on rice vinegar and soy sauce. Those who love spicy food also add hot chilli oil. The sauce is served in small bowls, where you dip hot gyoza.</p>

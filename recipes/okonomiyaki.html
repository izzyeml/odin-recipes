    <p>Okonomiyaki is a japanese street dish. It is described as a savory pancake made with vegetables, meat, and other ingredients.</p>
    <p> I will teach you how to make it! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul> Sauce </ul>
    <ul> Cabbage </ul>
    <ul> Flour </ul>
    <ul> Mayonnaise </ul>
    <ul> Egg </ul>
    <ul> Salt </ul>
    <ul> Scallion </ul>
    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol> Whisk together the okonomiyaki flour (or flour + baking powder + soy sauce/dashi powder) and water. To make the batter fluffier you can refrigerate for 1-8 hours to let the gluten rest. However, even if you don’t, the okonomiyaki will still taste good. </ol>
    <ol> Finely chop the cabbage and spring onion. Add the chopped vegetables to the batter. </ol>
    <ol> Mix the egg into the batter, being careful not to over mix, or the final okonomiyaki will be too chewy and tough. </ol>
    <ol> Thinly slice your protein and set aside. </ol>
    <ol> Heat the oil in a large frying pan or griddle, on medium heat. </ol>
    <ol> Once the pan is hot, add a circle of batter to the pan. The okonomiyaki pancake should be about 2cm thick, but can be made thinner to make cooking easier. </ol>
    <ol> Add the slices of protein on top of the okonomiyaki and cover with a lid. Cook for about 5 minutes covered. </ol>
    <ol> After the bottom of the pancake is browned, flip it over and cook covered for another 5 minutes. </ol>
    <ol> Flip a third time and cook uncovered for 2 minutes. </ol>
    <ol> Take off the heat, plate and add toppings of your choice: mayonnaise, okonomiyaki sauce etc. </ol>
    <h3> How to Make Okonomiyaki Sauce </h3>
    <ol> 1½ tbsp tomato ketchup </ol>
    <ol> ½ tbsp Worcestershire sauce </ol>
    <ol> 2 tsp honey </ol>
    <ol> 1 tsp dark soy sauce </ol>
    <p> Remember: You can buy pre-made okonomiyaki sauce at a japanese market. </p>
